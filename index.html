          <p>I'm a 3rd year student at <span class="highlight"><a href="https://northeastern.edu" target="_blank"> Northeastern University</a></span> majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. This past summer, I was a front end development intern at <span class="highlight"><a href="https://apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a></span>, where I worked on internal libraries and tools for apple.com.
          <p>Previously, I was a web development intern at <span class="highlight"><a href="http://nymag.com" target="_blank">New York Magazine</a></span> (June 2016 - May 2017), and a summer teaching assistant and intern at <span class="highlight"><a href="https://flatironschool.com" target="_blank">The Flatiron School</a></span> (June - August 2015).</p>
          <p>I enjoy listening to indie rock, rewatching <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>, and eating churros & paella.</p>

            <p class="grid-proj-desc">During my co-op at New York Magazine, I developed a reusable quiz template component with customizeable scoring on their Node-based CMS for editors to use. The quiz types supported were multiple choice, scale, and a simple agree/disagree quiz. It was built with Handlebars.js, SCSS, and client-side JavaScript.</p>

            <p class="grid-proj-desc">My first major project at New York Magazine was to build a bar and line chart visualization component. The idea is to allow editors to create these charts by just inputting data and selecting a few customizations. The article linked to the left used the base foundation of the component I developed, and it also added some changes to style and optimization. The component was built with Handlebars.js, SCSS, client and server-side JavaScript, and d3.js to spin up the visualizations.</p>

            <p class="grid-proj-desc">Another project I worked on at New York Magazine was a 100 Jokes interactive feature. I developed the component that was used to add x-amount of items in the list (in this case 100 jokes), as well as the component that acted as a container for that.</p>
